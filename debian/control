Description: Firewall administration tool GUI
 Firewall Builder consists of an object-oriented GUI and a set of policy
 compilers for various firewall platforms. In Firewall Builder, firewall
 policy is a set of rules, each rule consists of abstract objects which
 represent real network objects and services (hosts, routers, firewalls,
 networks, protocols). Firewall Builder helps the user maintain a database
 of objects and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop operations.
